## Package Changes
- No lockfile changes detected.

## Framework Transition Guidance
- `laravel`: `supported` (`7` -> `9`; evidence: `laravel-transition-1`, `laravel-transition-2`)
  - hop `7` -> `8`: `supported`; rule pack `laravel-7-to-8` (evidence: `laravel-transition-1`)
  - hop `8` -> `9`: `supported`; rule pack `laravel-8-to-9` (evidence: `laravel-transition-2`)

## Root Constraint Changes
- `laravel/framework`: updated `^7.0` -> `^9.0`. The declared root constraint differs from the requested target. (evidence: `root-constraint-1`)

## Blockers
- `transitive-package-conflict` `illuminate/support`: A transitive package constraint blocks the requested target. (high confidence; evidence: `solver-1`, `solver-2`, `solver-3`, `solver-4`, `solver-5`)
  - requested `-`; blocker `fixture/illuminate-consumer`; locked `1.0.0`; conflict `^7.0`
  - dependency path: `fixture/illuminate-consumer -> illuminate/support`
  - option: Upgrade or replace `fixture/illuminate-consumer`.
  - option: Choose a `illuminate/support` version compatible with the transitive constraint.

## Source Inventory
- None detected.

## Actionable Source Impact
- None detected.

## Framework Findings
- `laravel` `high`: Update the root laravel/framework constraint from `^7.0` to a constraint compatible with Laravel 9. (evidence: `laravel-framework-constraint-1`)
  - applies to hops: `8 -> 9`
- `laravel` `high`: Update or replace incompatible illuminate/support constraints before targeting Laravel 8: fixture/illuminate-consumer. (evidence: `old-illuminate-consumer-1`)
  - applies to hops: `7 -> 8`

## Staged Plan
1. **constraints** — Prepare the requested root constraint changes before dependency resolution. (evidence: `plan-1`, `root-constraint-1`)
   - Update the `laravel/framework` root constraint to `^9.0`.
2. **dependencies** — Resolve dependency blockers and review the resulting lockfile transition. (evidence: `plan-1`, `solver-1`, `solver-2`, `solver-3`, `solver-4`, `solver-5`)
   - Resolve the `transitive-package-conflict` blocker affecting `illuminate/support`.
   - Rerun the isolated Composer scenarios after resolving the reported blockers.
3. **application** — Apply source and framework migration work after dependency resolution is stable. (evidence: `plan-1`, `laravel-framework-constraint-1`, `old-illuminate-consumer-1`)
   - Address framework compatibility findings before runtime validation.
4. **validation** — Validate the upgraded project on the target runtime before release. (evidence: `plan-1`)
   - Validate the Composer manifest and installed platform requirements.
   - Run the project test suite and focused regression tests.

## Risk And Effort
- Risk: `high`
- Risk drivers:
  - Composer resolution is blocked.
  - Framework compatibility findings require review.
- Effort: `6-20` hours (low confidence)
- Effort components:
  - `dependency_resolution`: `3-8` hours
  - `source_changes`: `1-4` hours
  - `tests_and_debugging`: `2-8` hours
- Effort assumptions:
  - Estimate is heuristic until project-specific tests and Composer solver output are reviewed.

## Test Guidance
- **composer-validation** (`required`): Validate the edited Composer manifest before dependency installation. Command: `composer validate --strict`.
- **project-test-suite** (`required`): Identify and run the project test suite; no Composer test script was detected. Command: project-specific command required.
- **platform-requirements** (`required`): Confirm the installed dependencies satisfy PHP 8.1.0 and the deployment extensions. Command: `composer check-platform-reqs`.
- **focused-regressions** (`recommended`): Add or run focused regression coverage for the reported source and framework findings. Command: project-specific command required.

## Uncertainties
- No PHP source files were scanned.
- Dependency resolution does not prove application runtime compatibility; the project test suite must run on the target runtime.
- No Composer "test" script was found, so the project's canonical test command is unknown.
- Composer extension checks used the analyzer runtime because no complete explicit extension platform was supplied.
